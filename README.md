# Analyse u3a

A **local-only desktop analysis tool** for u3a membership data from the Beacon system.

## Overview

Analyse u3a helps u3a treasurers and membership secretaries gain insights from their Beacon backup files (`.xlsx`). Load your backup once and generate analyses on:

- **Membership patterns** — growth/decline trends, demographics by class
- **Group popularity** — subscription levels, trends over time
- **Attendance patterns** — inferred from group membership and Calendar data
- **Member churn** — joiners, leavers, and lapsed renewals
- **Renewal payments** — income totals, counts, and trends by year/class

## Data Privacy

**Your data never leaves your machine.** This app:

- Runs **locally only** — no cloud uploads or telemetry
- Makes **no external HTTP calls** with your member data
- Binds to `localhost` only
- Keeps data in memory while loaded — nothing is persisted to disk (except optional config files)

The backup file contains personal data (names, addresses, phone numbers, emails) and must be protected accordingly.

## Getting Started

### For End Users

Two ways to use Analyse u3a:

**1. In your browser (no install)** — open
[https://peterc66.github.io/analyse-u3a/app/](https://peterc66.github.io/analyse-u3a/app/)
and drop your Beacon backup onto the page. The page is a static bundle
served by GitHub Pages; everything runs in the browser tab and the page's
Content-Security-Policy blocks all outbound network calls, so member data
still never leaves your machine.

**2. As a desktop app** — download the latest installer for your
operating system from [Releases](https://github.com/peterc66/analyse-u3a/releases):

- **Windows:** `analyse-u3a-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon):** `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-arm64.dmg`
- **macOS (Intel):** `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-x64.dmg`

Run the installer and follow the prompts. The app will check for updates automatically.

> **First run note:** Windows may show a "SmartScreen" warning and macOS
> may say the app "is damaged" — both are because the app isn't yet
> code-signed. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for the
> click-through and `xattr -cr` workarounds. The browser version
> sidesteps both.

### For Developers

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS) with npm
- **Git**

#### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterc66/analyse-u3a.git
cd analyse-u3a
npm install
```

> **Don't run `npm audit fix --force`.** It will upgrade Vite past
> major-version compatibility with the React plugin and break the build.
> The two reported audit warnings (`fast-csv`, `tmp`) are in dead code
> paths inside `exceljs` that this app never exercises — they're safe
> to ignore. See the *Dependency hygiene* section in `CLAUDE.md`.

#### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a Vite dev server bound to `127.0.0.1:5173`. Open it in your browser, then:

1. Drag your Beacon backup (`.xlsx`) onto the page, or click **"Open File..."**
2. The app extracts the backup date/time and u3a name from the filename
   (pattern: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_<u3a name> u3abackup.xlsx`). If the filename
   doesn't match, you'll be prompted to enter the date manually.
3. The file is validated against the schemas — structural problems halt the load;
   individual bad rows are reported and skipped.
4. Once loaded, you'll see a snapshot list (drop more backups onto it to add
   them), a summary panel for the latest snapshot, and a grid of analysis
   cards. Click a card to open its list of analyses, then click an analysis
   to see its chart and table, with download buttons for CSV, XLSX, and SVG.
5. **Multiple backups for the same u3a:** each new file is checked against
   the u3a name in the filename. If it doesn't match the loaded set, you'll
   be asked to confirm before it's added. Trend analyses (e.g. *Total
   membership over time*) light up once two or more backups are loaded.

#### Building the Desktop App (Electron)

To build installers for Windows and macOS:

```bash
npm run build:electron
```

This compiles the React app, bundles it with Electron, and creates:
- `dist/Analyse-u3a-0.0.1.exe` (Windows)
- `dist/Analyse-u3a-0.0.1.dmg` (macOS)

> **Status:** ingestion, UI scaffold, and the analysis page framework are
> working. The five analysis categories are seeded gradually — see *Adding a
> new analysis* below for the registry pattern.

## Data Structure

The Beacon backup contains 23 sheets; this app uses 15 of them:

- **Members** — member records, status, membership class
- **Member Statuses, Membership Classes, Membership Fees** — reference data
- **Groups, Group members, Group Ledgers, Calendar** — group and attendance data
- **Finance Accounts, Finance Categories, Ledger, Detail** — financial records and renewal payments
- **Faculties, Venues** — organizational structure
- **u3a Officers** — contact information

For a complete data reference, see:

- `BEACON-DATA-STRUCTURE.md` — entity diagram and ingestion order
- `BEACON-DATA-MEMBERS.md` — member-related tables
- `BEACON-DATA-GROUPS.md` — group-related tables
- `BEACON-DATA-FINANCE.md` — financial tables and renewal payment identification
- `BEACON-DATA-CONTACTS.md` — officers

The Zod schemas in `schemas/zod/index.ts` are the runtime source of truth for data validation.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Desktop App | Electron + electron-updater | Native Windows/macOS apps with auto-updates |
| Hosted Web App | Vite + GitHub Pages | Same React bundle, served statically; strict CSP keeps data local |
| Runtime | Node.js (LTS) | Cross-platform, ships with Electron |
| Language | TypeScript | Strict type safety; schemas are TS-native |
| Excel parsing | exceljs | Battle-tested, same library as Beacon2 |
| Validation | Zod | Schemas already authored as Zod |
| UI | Vite + React | Fast dev loop, locally-bundled |
| Packaging | electron-builder | Creates .exe (Windows) and .dmg (macOS) installers |
| Charts | recharts | Locally bundled, React-idiomatic; pinned in `package.json` |
| Storage | In-memory only | Snapshots live in memory; never persisted to disk or browser storage |

## Important Limitations

The Beacon backup **does not include**:

- **Per-event attendance** — Beacon records group membership but not who attended which meetings
- **Left-on dates** — inferred from status (lapsed/resigned) and renewal dates, not explicit
- **Email engagement** — no open/click tracking
- **Login history** — out of scope

The UI surfaces these limitations rather than producing misleading charts.

## Renewal Payment Configuration

Beacon does not have an explicit "renewal" flag. Renewal income is identified by **transaction category**:

1. The app scans `Finance Categories` for a default match against `/subscr|renew|member.*fee/i`
2. You can override the selection in the UI — different u3as use different category names
3. Your choice is saved as a config file (no member data)
4. Renewal rows are pulled from the `Detail` sheet and matched to their parent `Ledger` record for date and payment method

See `BEACON-DATA-FINANCE.md` for the full recipe.

### Coding Conventions

- ES modules (`import`/`export`) — all relative imports use `.js` extensions
  because of `moduleResolution: NodeNext`
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any` unless commented
- "u3a" is always lowercase
- Validate at the boundary (Zod runs when the file is read; trust the parsed types
  everywhere else)
- Dates internally as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings
- No `localStorage` for member data
- No backward-compatibility shims

For the full set of architectural decisions (stack, validation strategy, privacy
invariants), see the **Architecture decisions** section of `CLAUDE.md`.

### Adding a new analysis

The five front-page cards are **categories**. Each category opens to a list
of **analyses**, and each analysis renders as a chart + sortable table with
CSV / XLSX / SVG download buttons. Adding a new analysis is two small steps:

1. Create `src/analyses/<category>/<id>.ts` exporting an `AnalysisDefinition`:

   ```ts
   import type { AnalysisDefinition } from '../types.js';

   export const myAnalysis: AnalysisDefinition = {
     id: 'membership-joiners-by-year',
     categoryId: 'membership-patterns',
     title: 'Joiners by Year',
     description: 'New member joins per calendar year.',
     // snapshots: 'latest' (default), 'all' (time-series), or 'pairs'
     run: (snapshots) => {
       const snap = snapshots[0];
       // ...derive { columns, rows } from snap.backup
       return {
         columns: [
           { key: 'year',  label: 'Year' },
           { key: 'count', label: 'New Members', align: 'right' },
         ],
         rows: [/* ... */],
         chart: { type: 'line', xKey: 'year', yKey: 'count' },
       };
     },
   };
   ```

2. Add one line to `src/analyses/registry.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { myAnalysis } from './membership/joinersByYear.js';
   export const ANALYSES: AnalysisDefinition[] = [
     countByClass,
     myAnalysis,
   ];
   ```

That's it. The category page picks it up via `categoryId`; the analysis page
renders it via the shared `DataTable` / `AnalysisChart` / `DownloadBar`. No
UI changes needed.

`run` receives `Snapshot[]`. The `snapshots` field on `AnalysisDefinition`
controls which snapshots get passed:

- **`'latest'`** (default) — only the most recent snapshot. Existing
  single-snapshot analyses use this.
- **`'all'`** — every loaded snapshot, sorted oldest → newest. For
  time-series / trend analyses (e.g. *Total membership over time*).
- **`'pairs'`** — every loaded snapshot; the analysis walks consecutive
  pairs itself. Reserved for joiners/leavers diff analyses.

Analyses with `snapshots: 'all'` or `'pairs'` are gated behind ≥ 2 loaded
snapshots — opening one with only one snapshot loaded shows an empty state
asking the user to load another backup.

**Cumulative-vs-point-in-time gotcha:** `Ledger`, `Detail`, `Group Ledgers`,
and `Calendar` already contain full history in *every* backup. Read them
from the latest snapshot only — never aggregate them across snapshots, or
income / events will be double-counted. Only the point-in-time sheets
(`Members`, `Group members`, `Groups`, `Membership Classes`, etc.) are
worth comparing across snapshots.

### Type-checking

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test          # run the suite once (also what CI runs)
npm run test:watch  # re-run on file changes during development
```

The suite is intentionally small and focused on the load-time guarantees
that, if broken, would silently corrupt every analysis: Zod row coercion
(`schemas/zod/_coerce.test.ts`), every sheet schema accepting a known-good
fixture row (`schemas/zod/parseSheet.test.ts`), the renewal-category
heuristic and ledger sign rule, and the filename → date/time regex
(`src/ingest/parseFilename.test.ts`).

When you add a new sheet, schema, or load-time invariant, add a test
alongside it. UI components are not unit-tested — exercise them through
`npm run dev` instead.

### Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR and on pushes to `main`:

- **Linux job (gating):** `npm ci` → `npm run typecheck` → `npm test` → `npm run build`.
- **macOS + Windows matrix:** `npm ci` → `npm run build`. Catches
  packaging-relevant regressions before a release tag is cut, without
  invoking the heavier `electron-builder` step (that still runs only from
  `release.yml` on tag push).

A failing CI job blocks the PR. The release workflow (tag-triggered)
remains separate and only runs on `v*` tags.

### Building for Production

**Hosted web app (deployed to GitHub Pages):**

```bash
npm run build:web
```

Output goes to `docs/app/`. The bundle has a strict
`Content-Security-Policy` injected (including `connect-src 'none'`) so the
page provably cannot make outbound network calls — that's how the privacy
guarantee survives off the desktop. `docs/app/` is gitignored; on push to
`main`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds it fresh and publishes the
whole `docs/` tree to GitHub Pages via `actions/deploy-pages`. (One-time
setup: in GitHub repo settings → Pages, set the source to "GitHub
Actions".)

**Vite-only bundle (intermediate output for the Electron build):**

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in `dist/`. This is what `electron-builder` consumes; not used
on its own.

**Desktop app build (for distribution):**

```bash
npm run build:electron
```

This creates platform-specific installers in `dist/`:
- `analyse-u3a-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe` (Windows NSIS installer)
- `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-arm64.dmg` / `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-x64.dmg` (macOS disk images)
- `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-arm64-mac.zip` / `analyse-u3a-X.Y.Z-x64-mac.zip` (macOS portable)

### Releasing to Users

1. Update `package.json` version (e.g., `0.0.2`)
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v0.0.2 && git push origin v0.0.2`
4. GitHub Actions automatically builds and publishes installers to [Releases](https://github.com/peterc66/analyse-u3a/releases)
5. Users will see an update notification the next time they open the app

See `RELEASES.md` for detailed release workflow.
